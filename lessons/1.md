# Introduction

Welcome to the class! This class is a basic introduction to programming. Hopefully by the end you will be able to create programs. While this class focuses on a single language, many of the skills you will learn will translate to many languages, meaning it will become much easier to learn them.

## The Language: JavaScript

For this class, we will be learning JavaScript. I chose JavaScript because it is easy to learn, widely used, and very forgiving. However, I may be biased, since JS is also the first language I learned.

### Example

JavaScript code looks like this:
```js
const x = 1;
let y = 2;
console.log(x + y); // 3
```

## Goals

By the end of this class, you should be able to right relativly complex programs in JavaScript, as well as understand the basics of programming.

## Outline

This class is split into 6 sections. The current plan is to cover the following:

1. Introduction & Variables
2. Flow Control: `if` & `switch`
3. Arrays & Loops
4. Objects
5. Functions
6. Project: Calculator

### Calculator

Over the course of this course (lol) you will assemble pieces of a simple calculator that can take math and figure out the answer, like this:
```js
console.log(calculator("2 * 3 + 2 - 12 / 4")); // 5
```

### Advanced Topics

If you finish early, or you wish to continue learning after the seminar ends, I will try to write some additional lessons about more advanced topics, like:

* Generators
* Promises & `async`/`await`
* Using JS with HTML: The DOM
* Using JS on servers: Node.JS
* Commonly used libraries
* Scope
* Object Oriented Programming: `class`
* Object Oriented Programming Part 2: `.prototype`
* Iteration and iterables: `for in` vs `for of`
* Weirdness: Why is `[] + {}` different from `{} + []`
* History of JS
