# Introduction

Welcome to the class! This class is a basic introduction to programming. Hopefully by the end you will be able to create programs. While this class focuses on a single language, many of the skills you will learn will translate to many languages, meaning it will become much easier to learn them.

## The Language: JavaScript

For this class, we will be learning JavaScript. I chose JavaScript because it is easy to learn, widely used, and very forgiving. However, I may be biased, since JS is also the first language I learned.
