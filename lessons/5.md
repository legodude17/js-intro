# Lesson 4: Operators

Now that we have data in variables, we want to do stuff with them. That's what operators are for. Operators work on operands, which can be virtually anything.

In addition, there tends to be classes of operators based on what types of data they work on. We will consider two classes here: math and logic.

## Table of Contents

## Types of Operators

Operators are classified by the number of operands they have.

### Unary

Unary operators have 1 operand (un = one). These include `!` and certain uses of `+` and `-`.

### Binary

Binary operators have 2 operands (bi = two). These include most operators.

### Trinary

Trinary operators have 3 operands (tri = three). The main trinary operator is the ternary operator, `?:`.

## Classes of Operators

As mentioned, there are two classes of operators we will be considering: math and logic.

### Mathematical Operators

Math operators generally work on numbers. You will most likely recognize most of these. Here's the main ones we will use:

* `+` - Adds two numbers
* `-` - Subtracts two numbers
* `/` - Divides two numbers
* `*` - Multiplies two numbers
* `**` - Puts on number to the power of the other

These are all binary operators. There are also a few unary operators:

* `+` - Converts something into a number
* `-` - Negates a number

### Logical Operators

Logic operators work on booleans. Here are the main binary operators:

* `&&` - AND. Checks if both values are true
* `||` - OR. Checks if either or both values are true

And there's also a unary logical operator: `!`, NOT, which flips the value. `true` becomes `false` and `false` becomes `true`.

### Other

The ternary operator is special, being similar to an `if` statement, and will be covered next time in flow control.

## Try It Out

Try adding some operators to the existing Repl. Add, subtract, etc.
