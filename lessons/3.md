# Lesson 2: Variables

Variables are one of the most fundamental parts of programming in almost any language. Here you will learn what they are, and how to use them.

## Table of contents

## What are Variables?

The easiest way to think of variables is as a box in which you put stuff. In this case, the stuff is data.

### Example

![Boxes](https://microbit-challenges.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/variable.jpg "Variables as Boxes")

This is JS would look like:
```js
const name = "Bob";
const winner = true;
const score = 35;

console.log(name, winner, score); // Bob true 35
```

## Variables in JavaScript

In JavaScript variables are declared with declarations, then assigned with assignments, then used by writing the name.

### Assignment

An assignment is an expression that looks like this:
```js
variable = value
```

Where `variable` is the name of the variable, and `value` is whatever value you wish to assign it to.

### Declaration

However, before you assign a variable you must declare it. This is done with a keyword, followed by the name you want to declare. There are three keywords to choose from, each has a different effect. You can also combine a declaration with an assignment, by simply adding an `= value` after the name. In contrast to assignment being an expression, a declaration is a statement. This means that while `a = b = 1;` is valid, `let a = let b = 1;` is not.

#### `const`

Using `const` will declare a varible that cannot be changed. This also means you must have an assignment with the declaration, since you can't assign it afterwards.

```js
const foo = 1;

console.log(foo); // 1
```

Attempting to reassign it will give an error:

```js
const foo = 1;

foo = 2; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

#### `let`

`let` works just like `const`, except it allows you to reassign it.

```js
let foo = 1;

console.log(foo); // 1

foo = 2;

console.log(foo); // 2
```

#### `var`

`var` works very similar to `let`, with a few minor and complex differences. In general, you should simply use `const` wherever possible, and `let` when you need to reassign it.

### Usage

Variables are used simply by referring to them by name whenever you would put a value, similar to in math.

```js
const x = 1;
let y = 2;

console.log(x, y); // 1 2

y = x;

console.log(x, y); // 1 1
```

### Keywords

Remember keywords from last lesson? They are important here as those words are not allowed as variable names. So the following code will cause an error:

```js
const if = 1; // SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'if'
```
