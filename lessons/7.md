# Lesson 6: Switch Statements

`switch` statements are the other main kind of flow control is JavaScript. They are not as common as `if` statements, but still very useful.

## Structure

`switch` statements start with the keyword `switch` and an expression inside parentheses. Then, inside braces, you have several instances of the keyword `case`, followed by an expression, followed by a colon, followed by statements, followed by a `break` statement. At the end you can have a `default` section as well.

```js
switch (expression) {
  case case1:
    statement;
    statement;
    break;
  case case2:
    statement;
    statement;
    break;
  default:
    statement;
    break;
}
```

## Function

The `switch` will take `expression` and then find the first `case` that matches it, meaning the two expressions are equal. If it doesn't find one, it chooses `default`. After that, it executes the statements beneath that `case` (or `default`).

## Example

```js
const day = 2;

switch (age) {
  case 1:
    console.log("Monday!");
    break;
  case 2: // 2 === 2, so this part runs
    console.log("Tuesday!");
    break;
  case 3:
    console.log("Wednesday!");
    break;
  case 4:
    console.log("Thursday!");
    break;
  case 5:
    console.log("Friday!");
    break;
  case 6:
    console.log("Saturday!");
    break;
  case 7:
    console.log("Sunday!");
    break;
}
// Tuesday!
```
